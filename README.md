# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo was created in fulfillment of my participation in the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my ability to ascertain raw data and transform said data into tidy data for subsequent analysis endeavors. 

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

Here are the data for the project:

This repository contains the following 
   1.	a codebook (which describes the procedure in reproducibility of the data and conceptualization of the data obtainment and transformation in generating tidy data), 
   2.	an R script called “run_analysis” (embedded the codes in conformity to the instructional guidance in the course project), 
   3.	a data file titled “tidy_data” (contains the output content following the transformation of the raw data), and this “readme file” (explains the description of the       repository).
